The following repository, hosts the code for the MVP version of PayPerks- an app that suggests users the best payment methods, to maximize his reward earnings.

For using the MVP, you can simply visit the website, and try out the functionality against the offered payment options.

Do note, the business logic is not on line, however, it is enough to mock the functionality and product convincing results
